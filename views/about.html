            Frank Lloyd Wright (June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator.
            He designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frank_Lloyd_Wright_works">more than 1,000
                structures</a> over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the
            architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and
            hundreds of apprentices in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliesin_Fellowship">Taliesin
                Fellowship</a>. Wright believed in designing in harmony with
            humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_architecture">organic architecture</a>. This philosophy was
            exemplified
            in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallingwater">Fallingwater</a> (1935), which has been called "the
            best all-time work of American architecture".
            <br /><br />
            Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_School">Prairie School</a> movement of architecture and also
            developed the concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usonia">Usonian</a> home in <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadacre_City">Broadacre City</a>, his vision for urban planning in
            the United
            States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums,
            and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Came_glasswork">leaded glass</a> windows, floors,
            furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous
            articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Architects">American Institute of
                Architects</a> as "the greatest American architect of all time". In 2019, a selection
            of his work became a listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">World Heritage
                Site</a> as <a

            apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lyman_Silsbee">Joseph

            home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife

            murder of Mamah and her children and others at his <a
